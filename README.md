# MLP
1) MLP from scratch for XOR classification. The aim of this project is to truly understand why we need a multi layer perceptron. The XOR (exclusive OR) problem is a classic problem in machine learning that showcases the ability of neural networks to learn non-linear decision boundaries.

2) MLP from scratch for a neural network that determines the location (position) of the receiver based on the reading of the radio signal strength. The input consists of signal strength readings from 16 radio transmitters, and the output is the position (x, y) of the recei
